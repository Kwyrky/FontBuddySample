FontBuddySample
===============

A sample project for the FontBuddy lib... nice for testing it and making sure it all still works

Here's a screenshot of how it should look:

Currently tested to work on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
